# Employee Churn Prediction Model with Strategic Retention Plan

Data source:ã€€https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset

In this project, we aim to understand whether an activive employee will leave the company and what are the key indicators. As the cost of replacing an employee can often be quite large, this prediction model can help us form policies or strategies that can be adopted based on the results to improve employee retention. 

Note: This is the final project for ISOM 672 Intro to Business Analytics at Emory Master of Science in Business Analytics.
